This library controls a Digilent Analog Shield connected to an Arduino
from Python over serial. There are three layers to the system: the
Arduino side (which controls the Analog Shield), the Python side
(which is what is exposed to the user), and the serial protocol that
communicates between the two.

# Quick start
1. Upload `analog_shield.ino` to the Arduino
2. Determine the serial port of the Arduino
   - Check the Arduino application
   - Mac/Linux only:
   ```
   $ find /dev -name 'ttyUSB*' -o -name 'ttyACM*' -o -name 'ttyAMA*'
   ```
3. Install dependencies (NumPy and PySerial):
   ```
   $ pip install numpy pyserial
   ```
3. Connect the Python library to the shield:
   ```python
   >>> import AnalogShield as AS
   >>> a = AS.AnalogShield("/dev/analog_shield_port")
   ```

## Example use
In example code throughout this document, I will use the variable `a`
to indicate an initialized `AnalogShield` object and `AS` to indicate
the module itself.

```python
>>> a.ramp_on(0) # Ramp on DAC 0
>>> a.ramp_amplitude(0, 3.3) # Set the amplitude of the ramp to 3.3V
>>> a.analog_read(2, 3) # Take 3 samples of ADC 2
[0.32415, 0.314525, 0.328846]
>>> a.analog_write(3, -2) # Set DAC 3 to -2V
```

# Python
All the code to control the Analog Shield is wrapped in the class
`AnalogShield`. The code is compatible with both Python 2 and 3
(tested on 2.7 and 3.6) and depends on NumPy (used to calibrate the
ADCs and DACs) and PySerial (to communicate with the Arduino).

Any method that requires a channel expects it to be either an integer
or the string `"all"`. Unless otherwise specified, `"all"` applies the
method to all channels. In places where there is no reasonable
behaviour for all channels (e.g. reading ADC), `"all"` is not a valid
value for the channel. This will be noted in the documentation for
that method.

## Initialization
- Initialize serial communications
  - 2 Mbps baud rate
  - Set timeout to 0
- Pause for 3s because it fixed some bugs
- Initialize ramp with known settings
  - Enabled: no
  - Period: 100ms
  - Amplitude: 5V
  - Offset: 0V
  - Phase shift: none
  - Shape: triangle
- Load calibrations, if provided
- Turn off queue mode
- Set all DACs to 0V
- For some reason, the first readings from each ADC were sometimes
  `0x0000`, `0x0000`, `0x00**`. To fix this, take five samples on each
  channel

## DAC and ADC
### `analog_write(channel, voltage, correct=True)`: output constant voltage
This method sets the value of one of the DACs. Voltage is expected as
a float. If the optional parameter `correct` is `True`, the method
will apply the correction function that was determined when the DAC
was calibrated (see the section on calibration for details on that
process). If the DAC hasn't yet been calibrated, a warning will be
printed.

Example use:
```python
>>> a.analog_write(2, -3.5) # Set channel 2 to -3.5V
>>> a.analog_write(0, 4.1, correct=False) # Set channel 0 to 4.1V while supressing error correction
>>> a.analog_write("all", 0) # Set all channels to 0V
```

### `analog_read(channel, samples=1, correct=True)`: sample the ADC
This method takes a number of samples (default 1) as fast as possible
from the ADC, then returns them as a list of floats. This function
cannot be applied to all channels simultaneously, so `"all"` is not a
valid channel. If the optional parameter `correct` is `True` and the
ADC has been calibrated, the correction function will be applied to
the measured voltages (see the section on calibration for details on
that process). If the ADC hasn't yet been calibrated, a warning will
be printed.

Since the ADC samples as fast as possible, a large number of samples
can be taken and then averaged to reduce error from a noisy
signal. The Arduino runs significantly faster than the Python code, so
taking several samples is not significantly slower than taking just
one.

Example use:
```python
>>> a.analog_read(1) # Poll channel 1 once
[1.1452345116]
>>> a.analog_read(3, 5) # Take five samples from channel 3
[-0.453614561, -0.5243512614, -0.4123516421, -0.4714526141, -0.5123161424]
```

## Ramping
The Analog Shield can output ramps on each DAC channel in
parallel. There are three available ramp shapes: triangle, sine, and
square. Ramp amplitude, period, offset, and phase shift can all be set
for each channel. Ramps are in phase unless set out of phase with a
phase shift.

Ramps that exceed the range of the DACs are clamped to Â±5V by the
Arduino.

### `ramp_running(channel)`: check if a ramp is currently enabled
Returns `True` if a ramp is running on the given channel. If the
channel is "all", this will only return `True` if ramps are enabled on
all channels.

### `ramp_on(channel)`: enable ramping on a channel
Enables ramping on the given channel with the current settings.

### `ramp_off(channel)`: disable ramping on a channel
Disables ramping on the given channel.

### `ramp_period(channel, time=None)`: set the period of the ramp
Set the period of the ramp, in milliseconds. If a new period is not
provided, the current value is returned.

Example use:
```python
>>> a.ramp_period(1, 100) # Set channel 1's period to 0.1s (10Hz)
>>> a.ramp_period("all", 31) # Set all periods to 31ms (~32Hz)
>>> a.ramp_period(3) # Query channel 3's period
12
>>> a.ramp_period("all") # Query all periods
[12, 197, 2632, 1]
```

### `ramp_amplitude(channel, voltage=None)`: set the amplitude of the ramp
Set the amplitude of the ramp, in volts. The amplitude of the ramp is
the difference between the maximum and average voltages. Consequently,
it must be positive. If a new amplitude is not provided, the current
value is returned.

Example use:
``` python
>>> a.ramp_amplitude(0, 0.14) # Set the amplitude of channel 0 to 0.14V
>>> a.ramp_amplitude("all", 3.14) # Set all amplitudes to 3.14V
>>> a.ramp_amplitude(2) # Query channel 2's amplitude
3.3
>>> a.ramp_amplitude("all") # Query all amplitudes
[1, 5, 3.3, 2]
```

### `ramp_offset(channel, offset=None)`: set the offset of the ramp
Set the offset of the ramp, in volts. If a new offset is not provided,
the current value is returned.

Example use:
``` python
>>> a.ramp_offset(3, -4.2) # Set the offset of channel 3 to -4.2V
>>> a.ramp_offset("all", -2.1) # Set all offsets to -2.1V
>>> a.ramp_offset(0) # Query the offset of channel 0
3.3
>>> a.ramp_offset("all") # Query all ramp offsets
[0, 5, -2, 4.21]
```

### `ramp_phase(channel, phase=None)`: set the phase of the ramp
Set the phase shift of the ramp, as a percentage of the period. For
example, if a ramp with a period of 100ms is given a phase shift of
10%, it will be offset 10ms. If a new phase shift is not provided, the
current value is returned.

Example use:
``` python
>>> a.ramp_phase(2, 50) # Set the offset of channel 2 to 50%
>>> a.ramp_pahse("all", 12.5) # Set the phase of all channels to 12.5%
>>> a.ramp_phase(1) # Query the phase of channel 1
75
>>> a.ramp_phase("all") # Query all phase shifts
[30, 10, 50, 90]
```

### `ramp_function(channel, function=None)`: set the shape of the ramp
Set the waveform of the ramp to one of three supported shapes:
triangle, sin, or square. For information on how these shapes are
defined, see the section on ramping in the documentation of the
Arduino program. If a new function is not provided, the current value
is returned.

Example use:

``` python
>>> a.ramp_function(2, "sin") # Use a sine ramp on channel 2
>>> a.ramp_function("all", "square") # Set all channels to a square ramp
>>> a.ramp_function(1) # Query the waveform of channel 1
"traingle"
>>> a.ramp_function("all") # Query all ramp functions
["triangle", "triangle", "sin", "square"]
```

## Calibration
For some reason, the DACs and ADCs that the Analog Shield uses have a
linear error. This means that it is easy to calculate compensation
functions that take the nominal input/output voltage and actual
input/output voltage (for the DACs and ADCs, respectively) and
calculate a function so that reverses the error.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wecassidy/AnalogShield/master/doc/dac_error.png" width="49%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wecassidy/AnalogShield/master/doc/adc_error.png" width="49%">

The Analog Shield library provides two functions to automatically
perform the calibration process, one for the DACs and one for the
ADCs. Both require a multimeter that has a Python interface be
connected to the computer. All that is required of the interface is that it
has a method `voltage()` that returns a number. If the method is named
something else, then it can be aliased by using the following code:
```python
multimeter.voltage = multimeter.other_method
```

Calibration is specific to each DAC and ADC channel. This means that
if you want to calibrate all four of each, you will have to run the
calibration methods eight times. A channel can be recalibrated at any
time by rerunning the calibrate function on that channel.

The error function seems to be fairly steady over time. To avoid
having to recalibrate the input and outputs every time the shield is
used, the correction functions will be saved to the hard drive using
the `pickle` module if a calibration file was provided (either in the
initializer or by later setting the value of the attribute
`calibration_file`).

The calibration functions work by measuring the error (`acutal -
nominal`) in 1V steps from -5V to +5V, then using NumPy's polynomial
fitting function to generate a linear function that reverses the
error.

### `adc_calibrate(channel, multimeter)`: calibrate an ADC
To set up, connect DAC 0 to both the desired ADC and the
multimeter. When the function is called, it follows the following
algorithm:

1. Start at -5V
2. Write voltage to DAC 0
3. Read multimeter value
4. Sample ADC 500 times and take the mean to reduce error due to noise
5. Increase by 1V and go to step 2
6. Generate error compensation function
7. If the calibration file is provided, update it with the new
   calibration function

Example use:
```python
>>> multimeter = HypotheticalSerialMultimeter("/dev/multimeter")
>>> multimeter.voltage()
1.42345
>>> a.adc_calibrate(0, multimeter) # Calibrate ADC 0
```

### `dac_calibrate(channel, multimeter)`: calibrate a DAC
To set up, the DAC to the multimeter. When the function is called, it
follows the following algorithm:

1. Start at -5V
2. Write voltage to DAC, suppressing any existing error correction
3. Read multimeter value
4. Generate error compensation function
5. Increase by 1V and go to step 2
6. If the calibration file is provided, update it with the new
   calibration function.

Example use:
```python
>>> multimeter = HypotheticalSerialMultimeter("/dev/multimeter")
>>> multimeter.voltage()
2.489735
>>> a.dac_calibrate(2, multimeter) # Calibrate DAC 2
```

## Queue mode
In queue mode, the Arduino waits for an external trigger before
executing commands. This allows for more precise timing. However, as
it is currently structured writing a command blocks until the command
completes. This means that execution of the program will hang if a
command in queue mode is not triggered for a long time.

There are two methods related to queue mode: `queue_on()` and
`queue_off()`. As the names suggest, they enable and disable queue mode,
respectively. Note that a queue mode off command won't execute until
triggered, just like all other commands in queue mode.

## Backend methods
Users shouldn't have to touch these methods, but they are documented
here for completeness.

### `write(command, arg=0)`
This method writes a command to the Arduino, following the serial
specification (see below). Its first parameter is the two-character
identifier of the command, and the second is the argument of the
command.

This method can be broadly divided into two steps: writing the
command, then reading the response.

The command is written as a series of four bytes: first the
two-character identifier, then the two-byte argument in big-endian
order (MSB first).

The method needs to perform some trickery to ensure that the code
works for both Python 2's bytestrings and Python 3's Unicode
strings. To this end, it first converts the identifier and argument
into a four-byte `bytearray`, where the four bytes are `[first
character, second character, MSB, LSB]`. This bytearray is written to
the serial port.

According to the serial protocol, responses are always terminated by a
semicolon (`;`). Because of this, the method simply consumes bytes
from the serial port until it reads a semicolon. Unfortunately,
`Serial.read()` returns a `bytes` object, whose behaviour differs
between Python 2 and 3. The check for a semicolon works by slicing the
last character off the response so far. In Python 2, `bytes` and `str`
are exactly the same thing (`bytes is str` is True), and slicing a
`bytes` gives a string. Meanwhile, Python 3's `bytes` is a distinct
type, and slicing it gives a number.  Therefore, two checks are
required: either the last entity in the response must be the string
`":"` (Python 2) or the number `0x3b` (Python 3), which is the ASCII
code for semicolon.

The method must ensure that it returns a Unicode string in Python 3,
to avoid unexpected bugs for the end user. Therefore we decode the
response using the Latin-1 encoding (which is back-compatible with
ASCII while leaving the possibility of using characters `\x80`-`\xff`
for future versions of the program, and each byte corresponds to a
single character).

The closing semicolon is required for effective operation of the
serial protocol but adds no value or information to the response once
read, so it is stripped before the response is returned.

### Voltage conversion functions
There are two functions `volts_to_bits(volts)` and
`bits_to_volts(bits)` that convert a number from volts to bits in the
Analog Shield format (see the Serial Protocol section for details) and
vice versa. These two functions are static methods, so they should be
called as:

```python
>>> AS.AnalogShield.bits_to_volts(0xd47a)
3.2999923704890524
>>> AS.AnalogShield.vots_to_bits(-2.5)
0x3fff
```

### `encode_num(number)`: encode a number for serial communication
This static method separates a two-byte number into individual bytes,
then returns them in a list. The bytes are in big-endian (MSB first)
order. Obtaining the two separate bytes are simple bitwise
operations. To get the most significant byte, shift the number right
eight bits, discarding the rightmost ones. To get the least
significant byte, perform a bitwise AND operation with `0x00ff`,
setting the MSB to zero while leaving the other byte untouched. Here's
what it looks like in binary:

```
Input number: 0100 1111 0010 1011

MSB: 0100 1111 0010 1011 >> 8 = 0100 1111
LSB: 0100 1111 0010 1011 & 0000 0000 1111 1111 = 0010 1011
```

Example use:

```python
>>> AS.AnalogShield.encode_num(1234) # 1234 = 0x04d2
[4, 210] # [0x04, 0xd2]
```

See also "Converting the argument" in the Arduino section for the
reverse process.

# Arduino
Basic flow of the Arduino program:

1. Read whatever is available in the serial in buffer
2. If the command is fully received, process it
   1. Split the command into identifier (first two characters) and
      argument
   2. Convert the argument from two bytes into an unsigned short
3. Run the ramp

Each group of commands (based on first character) has its own function
that processes the specific command and the argument. They return a
status code to determine successful execution (zero for success,
nonzero for an error).

## Converting the argument
We want to go from two separate bytes (for example, `0x4f` and `0x2b`)
to one two-byte number (`0x4f2b`). To do this, shift the first byte
left eight bits and add the second byte. Here's what the process looks
like in binary:

```
Input bytes: 0100 1111, 0010 1011

Step 1: 0100 1111 << 8 = 0100 1111 0000 0000
Step 2: 0100 1111 0000 0000 + 0010 1011 = 0100 1111 0010 1011
```

## Ramping
Each ramp shape is defined as a function of time since the Arduino
started executing (in microseconds to be as correct as possible). This
has a few consequences:

- Ramps with the same period are in phase
- It's very easy to add another ramp shape, simply define another ramp
  function
- There will be a discontinuity when the microseconds counter rolls
  over (approximately 70 minutes after the program starts)

The ramping code works by calculating the voltage at the current time
using the ramp function, then clipping if it goes out of range.

These are the functions that define the various ramps:
- Triangle: `V(t) = amplitude * (|(t - phase shift) % period -
  period/2| / (period/4) - 1) + offset`
- Sine: `V(t) = amplitude * sin(2Ï/period * (t - phase shift)) +
  offset`
- Square: `V(t) = amplitude * (-1)^floor((t - phase shift) / period) +
  offset`

# Serial protocol
The protocol works on a command-response basis: the Python side sends
a command, then blocks until the Arduino finishes executing the
command and returns a response.

The format of the command is simple: each command is exactly four
bytes in length. The first two bytes are the identifier of the
command, which consists of two ASCII characters. Commands are
case-insensitive, so the commands `RO`, `Ro`, `rO`, and `ro` are all
equivalent. The next two bytes consist of the argument. How it is
formatted is specific to each command. It may be interpreted as a
16-bit integer, it may be ignored, or it may be used another way
entirely. Commands which have similar functions are grouped by having
the same first character. Voltages are always communicated using the
bit format used by the Analog Shield library (i.e. `0x0000` corresponds
to -5V and `0xffff` corresponds to 5V).

The response is an arbitrary number of ASCII characters terminated by
a semicolon (`;`, ASCII `0x3b`). If the command completes successfully
with no other response required, it will return "OK;". If an error
occurs at any time, whether in parsing or executing the command, the
response will be "??;".

The serial protocol operates at a baud rate of 2 Mbps to reduce
communication latency.

## Command list

configurable.

Default settings:

- Ramp off
- Period: 100 milliseconds

### Queue mode
Queue mode enables more accurate timing of commands. Instead of
